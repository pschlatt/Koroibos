# Koroibos [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pschlatt/Koroibos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pschlatt/Koroibos)

## Project Description
This project serves as a two day "Coding Challenge" that required building various JSON objects to expose data pertaining to the 2016 Summer Olympics.  I was given a CSV file with over 3000 lines and asked to create and show relationships of this data as it pertains to the endpoints below. 

## Setup 
#### To Test Endpoints Locally
- ```$ git clone https://github.com/pschlatt/Koroibos.git```
- ```$ cd Koroibos```
- ```$ bundle install```
- ```$ rails db:{create,migrate}```
- ```$ rake import```
- Now you're all set to start making calls locally

#### To Run Testing Suite
- ```$ rspec```

If you would like to make these calls to the production server, the url is https://fast-tundra-51600.herokuapp.com/ followed by the uri of the endpoint

## Example Endpoints
#### GET
```/api/v1/olympians```
##### Example Response
